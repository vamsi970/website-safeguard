                     <p>Domestic violence is a form of abuse from a biological relative, mainly affecting women at the hands of male family members. This ranges from physical violence to mental, oral, sexual, and economic harming that makes someone incapable of having their rights assert against perpetrators. Some of the other vital acts include the Dowry Prohibition Act of 1861, prohibiting dowry in general, and sections 498A and 304B of the Indian Penal Code, which were enacted in 1983 and 1986, respectively. Later, PWDVA was enacted in 2005 which added a new definition to domestic violence by defining its mode of action.

                     <h2>Overview</h2>
                     <p>As part of the Safeguard initiative, the Central Government has put in place Women Help Desks, which are the first point of contact for distressed women, acting as a one-stop support center. These Help Desks provide police station emergency assistance all over the country-personal contact and 24×7 helpline service. The teams are specifically trained to empathize with victims and are sensitized to various women safety issues, whereby women are treated with care who seek help in such circumstances and receive the necessary support and redressal.</p>

                     <h2>Key Objectives</h2>
                     <p>It aims to make police stations friendlier and more accessible to work units, which may help decrease secondary victimization of abused women. It provides comprehensive emergency service with medical care needs of the victim and counseling, shelter, mental health services, and skills enhancement. The program also highlights rescue, prevention, and protection activities for women in such cases, alongside coordinating activities with other police stations and district AHTUs.</p>
